```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Roles

- **Doctor**: Can view appointments, chat with patients, view patient medical records
- **Admin**: Full system access including user management and story moderation

## 🗄️ Database Schema

- **Users**: Base user information with role
- **Patients**: Patient-specific information
- **Doctors**: Doctor-specific information
- **Appointments**: Appointment bookings

## 🧪 Testing

### Using Swagger UI
1. Run the application
2. Navigate to `/swagger`
3. Test endpoints interactively

### Using Postman
1. Import the API endpoints
2. Set up authentication with JWT token
3. Test all endpoints

## 🔧 Configuration

### JWT Settings (appsettings.json)
```json
"Jwt": {
  "Key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
  "Issuer": "PulseXAPI",
  "Audience": "PulseXClient"
}
```

### Database Connection
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=PulseXDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

## 📊 Sample Data

To create an admin user for testing:

1. First, register as a patient
2. Manually update the database to change user role to Admin (Role = 3)
3. Use that admin account to create doctors and other admins

Alternatively, you can seed data in the `ApplicationDbContext`:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    
    // Seed admin user
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>().HasData(
        new User
        {
            Id = 1,
            Email = "admin@pulsex.com",
            PasswordHash = PasswordHelper.HashPassword("Admin@123"),
            FullName = "System Administrator",
            Role = UserRole.Admin,
            IsActive = true
        }
    );
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using SHA256
- **JWT Tokens**: 7-day expiration
- **Role-Based Access**: Endpoints protected by role authorization
- **File Upload Validation**: Validate file types and sizes
- **Activity Logging**: Track all important user actions
